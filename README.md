# Intro

This repo serves to document a submission for the first automated segmentation price of the vesuvius challenge 2024.
It serves as a documentation on how to run the full automated segmentation pipeline and a decription of the algorithms used.

# Overview

The overall process consists of the following steps:
1. surface prediction volume generation
2. patch trace seeding
3. patch trace expansion
4. iterative surface tracing
    4.1. large surface tracing
    4.2. annotation
6. fusion & flattening of large traces
7. rendering
8. ink prediction
